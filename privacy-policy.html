            We collect the following types of information about you:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong> We ask for certain information such as your username, real name, birthdate, address, phone number and e-mail address when you register for a Helloblue account, or if you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. Your username and if you choose to disclose it, your real name, will be published publicly. Once published your username and / or real name may not be able to be removed.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Information we may receive from third parties:</strong> We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Helloblue application, linking your account to the Helloblue Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Helloblue. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join Helloblue. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Helloblue Service. You may also unlink your third-party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third-party service.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

            We use the information we collect in the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.</li>
            <li>To analyze, benchmark and conduct research on user data and user interactions with the Service.</li>
            <li>To provide you with information and services you request or that may be of interest to you.</li>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>
